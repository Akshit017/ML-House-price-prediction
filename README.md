## 📂 Project Structure

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains residential property data
- Features include property size, number of bedrooms, location-related attributes, and other numerical and categorical variables
- Target variable: **House Price**

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed feature distributions and correlations
- Identified missing values and outliers
- Visualized relationships between important features and house prices

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
